# Twitching Irishmen Pub
### Our objective is to build an Online Food Ordering System - a web-based application that allows customers to order their food for home delivery, or for pick up from the restaurant. Our imaginary client is a restaurant owner that needs a website where he can list his menu and allow visitors to place orders.

---
## Getting Started<br>

- Installation: To get up and running on your local system clone this repo and run `bundle install` and `rails db:migrate` 

- In this application we use pry-byebug as our debugger, feature testing with cucumber and unit testing with rspec.

`rake` runs both feature and unit testing.<br>
`rails server` to start the server on your local host.<br>
